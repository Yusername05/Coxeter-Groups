\subsection{Dihedral groups}

The dihedral group, $D_{2n}$, is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. Its standard presentation is given by
\[
\abr{r,s \ \middle| \  r^n = s^2 = e, \ (rs)^2 = e}
\]
where $r$ is a rotation of $2\pi/n$ and $s$ is a reflection.\\

Let $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ be two reflection axes with an angle $\theta$ between $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$, and $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ be the respective reflections. After some algebra, the composition $s_{1}s_{2}$ turns out to be a counterclockwise rotation through $2\theta$.\\

Therefore, an alternative presentation of $D_{2n}$ is given by
\[
\abr{s_1,s_2 \ \middle| \ s_1^2 = s_2^2 = e, \ (s_1s_2)^n = e}
\]
where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are adjacent reflections.\\

This shows that $D_{2n}$ is an example of a finite reflection group.

\begin{example}
The Coxeter diagram for the symmetries of a regular n-gon, also known as $I_{2}(n)$, looks like
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{scope}[shift={(0,-21.5)}]
        \node at (0,0) {$I_2(n)$};
        \begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle, fill=black, draw, thick, minimum size = 6pt, inner sep=0pt}]
            \node (1) at (2,0) {};
            \node (2) at (4,0) {};
        \end{scope}
        \begin{scope}[every edge/.style={draw,very thick}]
            \path [-] (1) edge (2);
            \node at (3,0.3) {$n$};
            \node at (6,0) {$(n\geq 4)$};
        \end{scope}
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

The precise meaning of these Coxeter diagrams will be given in \ref{subsection:reflection groups}.

\end{example}


\begin{theorem}
\label{}
Let \( G \curvearrowright X \) be an action of a finite group \( G \) on a finite set \( X \).  
Then the number of \( G \)-orbits in \( X \) is given by:
\[
\text{Number of orbits} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\mathrm{Fix}(g)|
\]
where \( \mathrm{Fix}(g) = \{ x \in X \mid g \cdot x = x \} \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}\cite{fraleigh}
How many distinguishable necklaces can be made using seven different colored beads of the same size?\\
    Let X be the $7!$ possible arrangements. The necklace can be turned over (a reflection) as well as rotated so we consider the dihedral group $D_{14}$ acting on X. Using the previous theorem, 
\[
\text{Number of orbits} = \frac{7!}{14}\ = 360
\]
as only the identity leaves any arrangement fixed.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
Let p be a prime. Then any group $G$ of order $2p$ is isomorphic to either the cyclic group $C_{2p}$ or the dihedral group $D_{2p}$.

\begin{proof}
By Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element \( a \in G \) of order $p$ and an element \( b \in G \) of order $2$. Let
\[
H = \langle a \rangle,
\]
so \( H \) is a subgroup of G of index 2, so \( H \trianglelefteq G \).

Since \( H \trianglelefteq G \), conjugation by \( b \) sends \( H \) to itself. Thus, there exists \( k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\} \) such that
\[
b a b^{-1} = a^k.
\]

Applying conjugation by \( b \) twice to \( a \) gives
\[
a = b^2 a b^{-2} = b (b a b^{-1}) b^{-1} = b a^k b^{-1} = (b a b^{-1})^k = (a^k)^k = a^{k^2}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
a = a^{k^2} \implies a^{k^2 - 1} = e.
\]

Since \( a \) has order \( p \), this implies
\[
p \mid (k^2 - 1),
\]
or equivalently,
\[
k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod p.
\]

Because \( p \) is prime, this implies
\[
k \equiv \pm 1 \pmod p.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item If \( k \equiv 1 \), then
\[
b a b^{-1} = a,
\]
and \( b \) commutes with \( a \). Hence \( G \) is abelian, and since \( a \) has order \( p \) and \( b \) has order 2, \( G \) is cyclic of order \( 2p \).

\item If \( k \equiv -1 \), then
\[
b a b^{-1} = a^{-1},
\]
which is the defining relation for the dihedral group \( D_{2p} \):
\[
D_{2p} = \langle a, b \mid a^p = e, b^2 = e, b a b = a^{-1} \rangle.
\]
\end{itemize}

Thus, $G$ is isomorphic to either $C_{2p}$ or $D_{2p}$.
\end{proof}

\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Infinite dihedral group}

We can also consider the group generated by two reflections $s_1,s_2$ with order of $s_1s_2$ infinite i.e.
\[
D_\infty = \langle s_1, s_2 \mid s_1^2 = s_2^2 = 1 \rangle
\]
This is the infinite dihedral group denoted by $D_{\infty}$. Note every finite dihedral group is a quotient group of $D_{\infty}$: \[
D_n \cong D_{\infty} / \langle (s_1 s_2)^n \rangle
\]
 $D_{\infty}$ can be taken as the symmetry group of the real line, with all integers distinguished. The generators can be any two consecutive distinguished points on that line. This is an example of an affine reflection group which we will define later in \ref{subsection:affine reflections}, and also the simplest example.

\section{Platonic solids and reflections}\label{section:solids}
\subsection{Platonic solids}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{platonic solids.pdf}
    \caption{The five Platonic solids.}
    \label{platonic solids}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
    A polyhedron is regular if its faces are regular polygons, all with the same number of sides, and also each vertex belongs to the same number of edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\cite{liebeck2019concise}
The only regular convex polyhedra are the five Platonic solids.
\begin{proof}
Before writing the proof, we introduce some notations:\\
$V$, the number of vertices;\\
$E$, the number of edges;\\
$F$, the number of faces;\\
$n$, the number of sides on a face;\\
$r$, the number of edges to which each vertex belongs.\\
Observe that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_1}
2E=nF
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_2}
2E=rV
\end{equation}
(\ref{eqn_1}) comes from counting the number of pairs $(e,f)$ where $e$ is an edge and $f$ is a face and $e$ lies on $f$; (\ref{eqn_2}) comes from counting the number of pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $v$ lies on $e$.\\
Substitute into Euler's formula, we get 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_3}
\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
Now $n\geq 3$, as a polygon must have at least $3$ sides and $r\geq 3$, since in a polyhedron a vertex must belong to at least $3$ edges. By (\ref{eqn_3}), we can't have both $n\geq 4$ and $r \geq 4$, since this would make the left-hand side of (\ref{eqn_3}) at most $\frac{1}{2}$.
It follows that either $n = 3$ or $r = 3$.
If $n = 3$, then (\ref{eqn_3}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_4}
\frac{1}{r}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
The right-hand side is greater than $\frac{1}{6}$, and hence $r < 6$. Therefore, $r = 3$, $4$ or $5$ and $E = 6$, $12$ or $30$, respectively.
If $r = 3$, (\ref{eqn_3}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_5}
\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
Similarly, $n = 3,4$ or $5$ and $E = 6,12$ or $30$, respectively.
These parameters coincide with those in the table above.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Let $G$ be the group of symmetries of a dodecahedron. What is $|G|$?\\
Let G act on the 12 faces of the dodecahedron and fix a face. There are $|D_{10}|=10$ symmetries which fix this face and our action is clearly transitive. By Orbit-Stabiliser theorem, $|G|=10\times12=120.$
Alternatively, this can be done by considering the fundamental domain, which is a triangle that uniquely determines the reflection. There are 120 such triangles.
\end{example}



We would like to study the group of symmetries of these Platonic solids.

\subsection{Cube}
We start by investigating the cube.


\tdplotsetmaincoords{60}{30}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[tdplot_main_coords, scale=1.5]

\draw[->] (0,0,0) -- (2.5,0,0) node[anchor=north east]{$x$};
\draw[->] (0,0,0) -- (0,3,0) node[anchor=south east]{$y$};
\draw[->] (0,0,0) -- (0,0,2.5) node[anchor=south]{$z$};


\def\s{1}


\draw[thick] (-\s,-\s,-\s) -- (\s,-\s,-\s) -- (\s,\s,-\s) -- (-\s,\s,-\s) -- cycle;

\draw[thick] (-\s,-\s,\s) -- (\s,-\s,\s) -- (\s,\s,\s) -- (-\s,\s,\s) -- cycle;

\foreach \x in {-1,1} {
  \foreach \y in {-1,1} {
    \draw[thick] (\x,\y,-1) -- (\x,\y,1);
  }
}

\draw[->, thick, red] (0,0,0) -- (1,0,0) node[below right] {$\mathbf{u}=(1,0,0)$};
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0,0) -- (1,1,0) node[below right] {$\mathbf{v}=(1,1,0)$};
\draw[->, thick, green!60!black] (0,0,0) -- (0,1,1) node[left] {$\mathbf{w}=(0,1,1)$};

\node[below left] at (0,0,0) {\(O\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
As, seen before, $s_{\mathbf{u}}$ and $s_{\mathbf{v}}$ generates the symmetries of a square. It turns out that $\mathbf{w}=(0,1,1)$, orthorgonal to $\mathbf{u}$, is a clever third and sufficient choice of vector, which gives $(s_{\mathbf{u}}s_{\mathbf{w}})^2=e$. Moreover, $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}=\frac{1}{2}$ so the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$, hence $(s_{\mathbf{v}}s_{\mathbf{w}})^3=e$. Thus the Coxeter diagram for the symmetries of the cube, also known as $BC_{3}$, looks like
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle, fill=black, draw, thick, minimum size = 6pt, inner sep=0pt}]
        \node (1) at (0,0) {};
        \node (2) at (2,0) {};
        \node (3) at (4,0) {};
    \end{scope}

    \begin{scope}[every edge/.style={draw,very thick}]
        \path [-] (1) edge (2);
        \path [-] (2) edge (3);
        \node at (1,0.3) {$4$};
        \node at (3,0.3) {$3$};
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

Equivalently, recall that this is equivalent to the group presentation
\[
\abr{s_1,s_2,s_3 \ \middle| \ s_1^2 = s_2^2 = s_3^2 = e, \ (s_1s_2)^4 = (s_2s_3)^3 = (s_1s_3)^2 = e}
\]

\subsection{Dual}
Before moving on to the other solids, we first introduce the concept of dual.
\begin{definition}
   The dual of a Platonic solid is a new Platonic solid where the faces and vertices are interchanged with those of the original. This can be
constructed by connecting the centers of each face of the solid, inscribing this new dual polyhedron
within the original solid.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{PlatonicSolidsDual.jpg}
    \caption{Duals of each Platonic solid.}
    \label{}
\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
    The tetrahedron is self-dual. The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair. The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A polyhedron and its dual have the same planes of symmetry, so they have the same Coxeter diagram. For example, the Coxeter diagram for the symmetries of the octahedron is again $BC_{3}$ as seen before.   
\end{remark}
