\subsubsection{Dihedral groups}

The dihedral group, $D_{2n}$, is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. Its standard presentation is given by\\
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{center}
$\langle r, s \mid r^3 = e,\ s^2 = e,\ (rs)^2 = e \rangle$  
\end{center}
\vspace{0em}
where r is a rotation of $2\pi/n$ and s is a reflection.\\

Let $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ be two reflection axes with an angle $\theta$ between $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$, and $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ be the respective reflections. After some algebra, the composition $s_{1}s_{2}$ turns out to be a counterclockwise rotation through $2\pi$.\\

Therefore, an alternative presentation of $D_{2n}$ is given by\\
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{center}
$\langle s_{1}, s_{2} \mid s_{1}^2 = e,\ s_{2}^2 = e,\ (s_{1}s_{2})^n = e \rangle$
\end{center}
\vspace{0em}
where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are adjacent reflections.\\

This shows that $D_{2n}$ is an example of a reflection group.

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{}
Let \( G \curvearrowright X \) be an action of a finite group \( G \) on a finite set \( X \).  
Then the number of \( G \)-orbits in \( X \) is given by:
\[
\text{Number of orbits} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\mathrm{Fix}(g)|
\]
where \( \mathrm{Fix}(g) = \{ x \in X \mid g \cdot x = x \} \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
How many distinguishable necklaces can be made using seven different colored beads of the same size?\\
    Let X be the $7!$ possible arrangements. The necklace can be turned over (a reflection) as well as rotated so we consider the dihedral group $D_{14}$ acting on X. Using the previous theorem, 
\[
\text{Number of orbits} = \frac{7!}{14}\ = 360
\]
as only the identity leaves any arrangement fixed.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
Let p be a prime. Then any group $G$ of order $2p$ is isomorphic to either the cyclic group $C_{2p}$ or the dihedral group $D_{2p}$.

\textbf{Proof}.  
By Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element \( a \in G \) of order $p$ and an element \( b \in G \) of order $2$. Let
\[
H = \langle a \rangle,
\]
so \( H \) is a subgroup of G of index 2, so \( H \trianglelefteq G \).

Since \( H \trianglelefteq G \), conjugation by \( b \) sends \( H \) to itself. Thus, there exists \( k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\} \) such that
\[
b a b^{-1} = a^k.
\]

Applying conjugation by \( b \) twice to \( a \) gives
\[
a = b^2 a b^{-2} = b (b a b^{-1}) b^{-1} = b a^k b^{-1} = (b a b^{-1})^k = (a^k)^k = a^{k^2}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
a = a^{k^2} \implies a^{k^2 - 1} = e.
\]

Since \( a \) has order \( p \), this implies
\[
p \mid (k^2 - 1),
\]
or equivalently,
\[
k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod p.
\]

Because \( p \) is prime, this implies
\[
k \equiv \pm 1 \pmod p.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item If \( k \equiv 1 \), then
\[
b a b^{-1} = a,
\]
and \( b \) commutes with \( a \). Hence \( G \) is abelian, and since \( a \) has order \( p \) and \( b \) has order 2, \( G \) is cyclic of order \( 2p \).

\item If \( k \equiv -1 \), then
\[
b a b^{-1} = a^{-1},
\]
which is the defining relation for the dihedral group \( D_{2p} \):
\[
D_p = \langle a, b \mid a^p = e, b^2 = e, b a b = a^{-1} \rangle.
\]
\end{itemize}

Thus, \( G \) is isomorphic to either \( C_{2p} \) or \( D_{2p} \).

\hfill\(\Box\)

\section{Platonic solids and reflections}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{platonic solids.pdf}
    \caption{The five Platonic solids.}
    \label{platonic solids}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
    A polyhedron is regular if its faces are regular polygons, all with the same number of sides, and also each vertex belongs to the same number of edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The only regular convex polyhedra are the five Platonic solids.\\
\textbf{Proof}. Before writing the proof, we introduce some notations.
V, the number of vertices;\\
E, the number of edges;\\
F, the number of faces;\\
n, the number of sides on a face;\\
r, the number of edges to which each vertex belongs.\\
Observe that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_1}
2E=nF
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_2}
2E=rV
\end{equation}
(1) comes from counting the number of pairs (e,f) where e is an edge and f is a face and e lies on f; (2) comes from counting the number of pairs (v,e) where v is a vertex and v lies on e.\\
Substitute into Euler's formula, we get 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_3}
\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
Now $n\geq 3$, as a polygon must have at least $3$ sides and $r\geq 3$, since in a polyhedron a vertex must belong to at least $3$ edges. By (3), we can't have both $n\geq 4$ and $r \geq 4$, since this would make the left-hand side of (3) at most $\frac{1}{2}$.
It follows that either $n = 3$ or $r = 3$.
If $n = 3$, then (3) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_4}
\frac{1}{r}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
The right-hand side is greater than $\frac{1}{6}$, and hence $r < 6$. Therefore, $r = 3$, $4$ or $5$ and $E = 6$, $12$ or $30$, respectively.
If $r = 3$, (3) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_5}
\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{E}
\end{equation}
Similarly, n = 3,4 or 5 and E = 6,12 or 30, respectively.
These parameters are coincide with those in the table above.

\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Let $G$ be the group of symmetries of a dodecahedron. What is $|G|$?\\
Let G act on the 12 faces of the dodecahedron and fix a face. There are $|D_{10}|=10$ symmetries which fix this face and our action is clearly transitive. By Orbit-Stabiliser theorem, $|G|=10\times12=120.$
Alternatively, this can be done by considering the fundamental domain, which is a triangle that uniquely determines the reflection. There are 120 such triangles.
\end{example}



We would like to study the group of symmetries of these Platonic solids.

\subsection{Tetrahedron}
Each face has $D_{6}$ as a group of symmetries.





Before moving on to the other solids, we first introduce the concept of dual.
\begin{definition}
   The dual of a Platonic solid is a new Platonic solid where the faces and vertices are interchanged with those of the original. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    The tetrahedron is self-dual. The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair. The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.
\end{remark}
